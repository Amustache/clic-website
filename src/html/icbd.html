                                One of the key points of this day : throughout the day,
                                you will have the opportunity to pass a mock interview, oriented for IC students.
                                Recruiters from various companies, such as Google and Swisscom will run simulated interviews in groups,
                                at the end of which you will receive a feedback : where did you go wrong, what are your good points,
                                what you should improve, etc. This unique experience will allow you to approach
                                your next real interview with more serenity.

                                From 12:00 to 13:30, and for only CHF 10, you will have the opportunity to have
                                an informal lunch with 25 alumnis. They are here for you, so you can ask them
                                as many questions as you wish, and find someone that can answer your questions.
                                This will be a standing lunch, so you won’t be forced to stay close to someone you don’t connect with.
                                You can speak to all of them if you wish!

                            <p>
                                Coding interviews are not an easy thing, and often a bit scary for the first few times.
                                But no need to be afraid! This talk, by Damien Engels (former CLIC member now working at Google),
                                will tell you all you need to know about those interviews : how to prepare,
                                what are the different ways to approach them, and the best techniques to win.

                            <p>
                                During your master, you must do an internship. Many IC students also chose to do their
                                Master thesis during this internship. Come listen to Guillermo Barrenetxea Kobas,
                                recruiter at Swisscom, explain what behaviour adopt during an internship to socialize,
                                and learn the most you can.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Julien Perrochet has spent several months overseas to meet partners of our faculty,
                                and renews ties for possible internships. During this time, he met many companies
                                and convinced them to hire EPFL IC students. During his talk, he will tell his story,
                                and how networking is made in an ever more competitive market.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Having a master will open many doors; one of them is to do a PhD.
                                But many rumours run about this title : unemployable because too skilled ?
                                Or the best profile in town ? A guaranteed career in academia ?
                                We will host two points of view : Mohamed Kafsi has completed his PhD
                                and started working in the industry, while Prof. Grossglauser preferred staying in academia.
                                Tempted to do a PhD ? You can’t miss this exciting discussion!

                            <p>
                                A hurtful stereotype about our field is that it’s a sexist place.
                                Sadly, we are far from having an equal proportion of men and women,
                                even though the latter are just as capable.
                                This panel will host Amina Chebira, ???, ??? and ???, women who successfully
                                completed their studies in IC, and are now working in the industry. Come listen to their story,
                                the problems they faced and how they solved them.
